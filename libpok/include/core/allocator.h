/*
 * This file contains memory allocation functionnalities.
 * You can tweak/tune the memory allocator with the following macros:
 *  - POK_CONFIG_ALLOCATOR_NB_SPACES : the number of memory spaces
 *    that can be allocated. It can corresponds to the successive
 *    call of malloc() or calloc() or pok_allocator_allocate()
 *  - POK_CONFIG_ALLOCATOR_MEMORY_SIZE : the amount of memory
 *    the allocator can allocate

/*
 * This function allocates memory. The argument is the amount
 * of memory the user needs. This function is called by libc
 * functions malloc() and calloc()
 */

/*
 * This function frees memory. The argument is a previously
 * allocated memory chunk. Be careful, the time required
 * to free the memory is indeterministic, you should not
 * free memory if your program has strong timing requirements.
