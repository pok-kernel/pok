 * \brief   Ceasar crypto protocol.
 *
 * This is a very basic crypto protocol that just
 * change the order of bytes in data. There is no
 * public/private key, the algorithm is known
 * by the attacker so that it's a very weak crypto
 * protocol.
 * Interested people can gather more information
 * about this protocol on:
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher
 *
 * We don't provide an associated marshalling type
 * for the Ceasar protocol since the crypted size
 * is the same than the uncrypted size.
