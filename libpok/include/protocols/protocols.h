 * \brief   Protocols to marshall/unmarshall data
 *
 * This file is a general-purpose file to include all
 * protocols in the same time. Protocols functions
 * provides features to encode and decode messages
 * before sending data through partitions. It is
 * especially useful when you want to encrypt data
 * over the network before sending or adapt application
 * data to a particular protocol.
 *
 * For each protocol, we have:
 *   - One function to marshall data
 *   - One function to unmarshall data
 *   - One data type associated with the crypto protocol.
 *     This data type is used to store data when marshalling
 *     data and used as an input to unmarshall data.
 *
 * More documentation is available in the user manual.
